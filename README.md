## 📌 Dataset Used

**📂 Student Performance Dataset**  
The dataset contains student performance in different subjects along with demographic details such as:

- Gender
- Parental education level
- Test preparation course
- Scores in Math, Reading, and Writing

This dataset helps uncover patterns and influences in student academic outcomes.

---

## 📊 Visualizations Included

- **Distribution of Math, Reading, and Writing Scores**
- **Gender vs. Performance**
- **Impact of Parental Education Level**
- **Correlation Heatmap**
- **Boxplots & Countplots**
- **Effect of Test Preparation on Scores**

Each graph is explained with a short narrative to aid in storytelling and derive actionable insights.
